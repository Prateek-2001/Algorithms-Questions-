## Few Algorithm Questions on C

1.	Print n numbers in Fibonacci series that are even.  
<br />
2.	Given an unsorted array of size N, find Mth smallest number. Try to solve with Run time complexity <= O(N) and additional space request is O(1). <br />
Example: {5,4,1,3,2} M = 2. Then 2nd smallest is 2
